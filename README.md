# Goals

The goal for this project is to provide people with an easy and safe way to implement envelopeBudgetting in their life. 

## Easy to use

Creating and maintaining budgets should be quick and easy. Budgeting in itself is an not-so-fun task, so the minimal effort should be required. 
This means that setting a budget should be straightforward. 
Whenever a new transaction is entered, the user should get immediate feedback on the effect on their budget. 

## Self managed data

Financial data is very sensitive and valuable data. This means that under no circumstances, should this data be stored anywhere outside the users own machines. Users are encouraged to take steps to secure their data with encryption, but the application itself does not offer encryption. This would give a false sense of security. 

Data will never be stored on an external server automatically. Users can choose to set up a server for syncing if they please. But the application should always be usable without external server. syncing over LAN will always be supported. 

## Good documentation and education

The application should come with good documentation to inform the user on what the Envelope Budget method is, and how this program can help them. This program cannon be useful without any good documentation.

#current progress

Right now, the application is still in it's 'planning'-phase. So it does not exist yet. Please be patient.
